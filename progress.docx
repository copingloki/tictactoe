Importing Required Libraries:
-The code starts by importing the necessary libraries: math, time, and random.
Player Classes:
-There are three player classes defined: Player, HumanPlayer, and two AI player classes, SmartComputerPlayer and SmartComputerPlayerAlphaBeta.
-Player is the base class for all players and provides a common structure for player objects.
-HumanPlayer is a class for human players who input their moves through the console.
-SmartComputerPlayer and SmartComputerPlayerAlphaBeta are AI player classes that use different algorithms to make intelligent moves.
Class Definitions:
-TicTacToe is defined as the main game class.
Initialization and Welcome Message:
-The code initializes the game board and sets the current winner to None.
-It also prints a welcome message explaining that the game uses the minimax algorithm for AI moves.
Printing the Game Board:
-The print_board method is responsible for printing the Tic-Tac-Toe board to the console.
Printing the Numbered Board:
-The print_board_nums method prints the Tic-Tac-Toe board with numbers, so the user knows which square corresponds to which number.
Making Moves:
-The make_move method checks if a move is valid (square is empty) and updates the game board with the player's move.
Determining the Winner:
-The winner method checks if a player has won the game by examining rows, columns, and diagonals.
Checking for Empty Squares:
-The empty_squares method checks if there are any empty squares left on the board.
Counting Empty Squares:
-The num_empty_squares method returns the number of empty squares on the board.
Listing Available Moves:
-The available_moves method returns a list of available (empty) squares on the board.
Game Initialization and Replay Variable:
-The replay variable is set to 'y', indicating that the game can be replayed.
Play Function:
-The play function allows two players to take turns until there's a winner or a tie.
-It alternates between the X player (AI) and the O player (human).
The function takes arguments:
-game: The TicTacToe instance.
-x_player: The X player (AI).
-o_player: The O player (human).
-print_game: A boolean to determine if the game board should be printed.
-replay: A variable to control whether the game should be replayed.
Within the game loop:
-The current player (X or O) is determined.
-The player is asked to make a move using their respective get_move method.
-The move is validated, and if valid, it's made on the board.
-The board is printed if requested.
-The game checks if there's a winner, and if so, it announces the winner and asks if the player wants to replay.
-The game alternates between players until the board is full (tie) or someone wins.
Main Function:
-The main function is the entry point of the program.
-It welcomes the user and allows them to choose between two AI players (regular minimax or minimax with alpha-beta pruning).
-Then, it initializes the game with the chosen AI player and a human player and starts the game.
Execution:
-The code block at the end of the script runs the main function if the script is executed directly.
